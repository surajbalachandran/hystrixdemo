###Monolithic Architecture

* Enterprise application is divided to 3 main parts:
    * Client side (UI)
    * Server side (services)
    * Database 
* Server side is the Monolith (bundled and executed as a single logical resource)
* Horizontal scaling by running many instances behind the load balancer
